# The Sovereign of Beauty
## The Duino Elegies by Rainer Maria Rilke
> For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror which we are still just able to endure, and we are so awed because it serenely disdains to annihilate us

Here the focus is on marrying the **Lovecraftian sense of horror to the magnanimity of beauty's embrace**. Jean sheer willpower and her ability to overpower the circumstances laid out by divinity should send a shiver of awe down your spine. Skaladriel is this **accumulation of  the "terror" of beauty**.
## The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky
> The awful thing is that beauty is mysterious as well as terrible. God and the devil are fighting there, and the battlefield is the heart of man.

Beauty’s duality—its capacity to inspire both divine transcendence and destructive obsession—reveals its terrifying power to corrupt or elevate. **As the originator of the ideals of beauty, this guy should obviously be of reference.**

# Defying the London Laplace Demon
## Thus Spoke Zarathustra by Friedrich Nietzsche
> "I say unto you: one must still have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star."

Nietzsche’s Übermensch creates beauty through will-to-power, overthrowing the “dead God” of determinism to invent new values. This is the best descriptor for Jean's role in the grand narrative as the **Agent of Change.**
## Notes from Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky
> “I say let the world go to hell, but I should always have my tea.”

The Underground Man rages against deterministic philosophies, asserting that human irrationality and desire for beauty  disrupt any “mathematical” divine plan. This is the crux after all.
## The World as Will and Representation by Arthur Schopenhauer
> “Art is the work of genius, which… plucks the object of its contemplation from the stream of the world’s course.”

Aesthetic experience temporarily suspends the deterministic “will,” offering liberation through sublime beauty.
## Les Misérables by Victor Hugo
> “Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise.”

Jean Valjean’s acts of mercy and love (embodying moral beauty) defy his “fated” identity as a criminal, rewriting his destiny through will. Since there is literally a Jean in here I should take a look lol.

# The Final Savior of Humanity
## Process Theology  of Alfred North Whitehead
> “God is the poet of the world, guiding it by his vision of truth, beauty, and goodness.”

Whitehead’s God is not a deterministic "Laplacian" force but a persuasive collaborator, offering possibilities (lures) for creation. Humans exercise free will by responding to these aesthetic ideals—beauty becomes the bridge between divine suggestion and human choice. **This could be the ultimate version of divinity Jean could take on.**

The tension between divine order and human freedom hinges on beauty as both a divine lure and a subversive force. Whether through art, moral action, or existential choice, beauty becomes the “wild card” that destabilizes mechanistic fate, affirming the power of will to reshape destiny.
