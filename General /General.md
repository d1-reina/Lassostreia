Mikaela(Shasha's Older Sister)
Qingyi has multiple personality each corresponding to a lover

Zanno the only place that shifted gods from light to aemos, that's why the world's magic is so weird

The reason Jean is first is because her reason is the simplest. She wanted to see us again and that's why we go to London. To ultimately repeat the tragic end, just so the beautiful journey can be enjoyed one last time. When we encounter her for the first time we stop s bunch of bullies from beating her up and say the line "if you have to choose between the world or yourself, choose yourself because the world will always choose itself".

Might be able to foreshadow that everyone is dying voluntarily by having methods of death that they would never die to understand normal circumstances

This could be a story in London, or a side quest in Nukroy to foreshadow

Shadow is a missing light, like how Lithium is missing from the universe

The Elegy is already reeling from the previous failed revolution by Alia

What if Aisha was like a semi legal enforcer for the Elegy Guard that handles the worst cases in secret, and she has to deal with the nightmares of hunting innocents

Despite being blind, Zain has always loved exploring the world much to the annoyance of his parents who had to constantly send Aisha to go find him as a child

Characters with morals that usually lead to the decision you would expect until they start making decisions that you think are antithetical to them personality

WHAT IF QINGYI IS JUST ALICE AND THE LOVERS ARE ALL WARLORDS OF CHINA FIGHTING TO UNITE THE PLACE KEKWAIT CINEMA

You know that thing we do where we hold our hands like a book and look into them. That feeling of running a thumb on someone else's palm


Do you love me? Or so you just want to save me? Honorary Knight. Fenrir asks Mystra

Adding onto how Stelle can make mindscape into battles we can say that this entire world is a memory being run over and over again by the FAM that shouldered the burden for countless eons to get to the iteration where the water goddess ressurects from the ocean(anything past the horizon of non existence). So the FAM realm must be it's own entity outside of Lasso.

So as far as history recounting endgame goes well have Peris Experiments on Oceanids, FAM Lore and readables about mysterious pasts that seem to be repeating. Sacerdos was a PE iteration of Nukroy?


Jean is a master top and the girls in the club say they'd love to date her if she was a guy. This should add to the "Is it that hard to love me" later. This is also why she tops, to serve others

In the scene where it's Aishas turn to die, Zain breaks down crying when she asks whether everyone will die. He throws hands at her pleading her to hate him for what he has prophesized. Losing strength in his legs he begins to slump but is quickly ChisaTaki lifted into the air by a smiling Aisha, just like back in their desert village, where she says she can never hate him and this is what is ought to happen


In the grand ending we need to choose Jean or the world. The tgirl in JP creates a space of judgement where we are given this choice. We are first pleades by our companion Fuli to choose his gf the water goddess. You can accept and save the world. Or you can save Jean. This is a 2 way battle as you right Fuli outside and Jean fights the water goddess inside. She keeps telling you not to save her but breaks down as you keep trying harder and finally you and tgirl pull her put of the void, now materialized as the goddess of Beauty.

In the ending of London there's a irreversible choice. Jean asks us who we are and what relationship we had with her. You can choose to tell her you loved her in which case she'll say i see. You're also allowed to say you're best friends which she sees through immediately and asks heartbroken 'is it that hard to love me'. Instant regret hits stelle as she breaks down and begs for another chance but is cast away, out of Jean's room. This is when Fuli will give you a reset to do the right thing. Jean initially plans to kill twice as many people so that both her and Stelle can escape. But she later realises she doesn't want to burden stelle with the weight of those deaths like she is, so she lies to stelle that both can escape. At the very end she pushes us out of the Laplace demon and breaks a cog in the machine, causing the sovereign diety of London to surrender it's authority to our Cthulu ending the London arc.


America unique feature is to turn any interaction into a tower battle, we can weave in combat in story like this

France is a post body society. In the sense that since the soul is the only thing that matters, people are post gender. Cyberhuman and ofc this dynamic of dialetical dismantling of gender norms should play a big role

Blind twink in the kitchen cooking when the husband(a woman) gently hugs him from behind, sliding her feet under his lifting him up onto them and kissing his neck. Good morning sweetheart

At the climactic part we must make a choice between allowing FM to rssurect the water goddess or we bring back Jean. The weight of that choice should be relevant and regretful

Jean's backstory in London should be how her condition would've never been taken serious until she was hospitalized for her brain rejecting her body. Our journey should be with a kid Jean who truly believes no context of circumstance will justify or explain her actions versus our desire to absolve a loved one of their evils.



The collective dream appears as completely different realities for each person in it. So for mc it's a perfect Nukroy. This is a critique of how the internet and media have locked each one of us in an alternate reality

There should be something in every chapter that can make someone go 'this is my favourite chapter '


Frigid Matrix has realised it is in a game and hence guides the player (like paimon kinda) through the game making them choose the right path to revive his love the god of beauty


Scrap and use/reuse ruins of multiple civilizations past. The decomposition of ideas and systems/orders

The God of Romance should be an aroace that suffers from bpd since they have a different personality for each person this is not me projecting okayge


Sasha's older sister, the adopted child of fenrir and mystra is dumb i.e. she can't speak. She's the main dancer of the group but constantly gets shit for not being able to sing etc she shouldn't be there etc.

Point 2
Mystra cheated on Fenrir early in the relationship. This will be the incident where she's kicked out of the house and goes to Emily etc.

Side Idea
The Singaporean war one where we have a group of guys resisting. World powers don't help cuz of 'sphere of influence' and other geopolitical bs. Each member has things they wanna do before eventually dying . One of the wants to be a woman. Dies before becoming one but says his dad wouldn't take him in anyways. Superpower now comes in since the situation is favorable and helps beat the Nazis. Guy visits the dad's pendant shop and asks for a pendant with a photo of the woman he loved. They both silently leave as the dad breaks into tears over his lost daughter.

Trans Magical Girl?????? So in the flower queer revolution thing. Everyone can blossom from a flower transformation. Except ace people since it's linked to ur sexual expression. So when the flower detonates it only kills non ace people

That one where a warlord leads a rebellion against the kingdom and the princess(trans girl) fires a nuke that gives everyone a near death experience. Warlord tries to comfort her??
This could result in princess running away with weapon, leading the resistance with her gf and overthrowing the monarchy


Fenrir has a serious case of the different personalities with different people. Later on as things heat up between him and mysta perhaps he can have imposter syndrome of whether he actually loves her or just built a personality like that
SCRATCH THAT
Remember the memory loss trans fic of ur political oc. The one u dump all ur political stuff and speeches on.
Fenrir and Mystra fall in love pretty vanilla and then Fenrir goes into a coma wakes up a girl. They fall in love again. The story should run them to similar scenarios as the past and edge on how similar yet different the new Fenrir is . LET'S CALL THIS SERIES UNCANNY VALLEY

Make "Free City of Dragonsport" a Israel Palestine allegory

Let's says The Force God has his "Order of Sons" who carry out his will. One of them is an AFaB who breaks out of control by profusing she's a man but not his son. They all have a binding locket which nobody has figured out how to break. He first believes that it only works on men, so if he embraced womanhood it would break but we find out it works on filhal piety instead

Let's also say he was the first one too see him as a man, so it's a heartwrencher for her to abandon him

When Fenrir is replaced he wakes up in the mechanical plane of the UAH. Finds out the plan and returns to mortality as a robot. Has a sad farewell with Mystra since she now loves the girl Fenrir. Joins the seven servants.

Replaces the druid who dies during the war. Emotional moment since the druid was like a Gramps for fenrir and he thought fenrir had died till the robot showed up at his deathbed.

We later find out when Fenrir in coma, Mystra is the one asked for operation permit as she is technically the closest as he's actually adopted

The empire is shown as something deeply unpopular, so let's try show a fascist with popular support like Modi instead

Freya(Fenrir post coma) has a deep feeling of love for Mystra but is scared since she can't tell if it's hers or fenrir. Point should be "why does it matter?"

Create some tension between fem aether and dehya. She's always seen him as someone perfect, so doesn't believe it when rumours fly that he's part of a rebellion in clg. Since she takes the book so seriously. Only her experiences with their trans aunt break her deep rooted religious beliefs.

Fenrir should have a pet cafe, where u can adopt the pets too

Fenrir's birth parents are the ones who paralyzed him as a child. They gave him away to Ciplia who then raised him. That's how he met Emily

Since you can't simply regenerate souls, perhaps we can make it such that he's transferring other people's future to the general instead.

This raises the question of how the bipolar deity can generate energy from seemingly herself

Fenrir's mom went crazy trying to make him study and killed herself cuz she was depressed he would end up like her? This is why he's studied so hard since


Pacific Rim Minus One

The inventor girl who lost her parents to the monsters pairs up with a kendo girl who almost got grape by the monsters(men☕), work to pilot that Japanese gen 1 mech. Due to budget constraints and typical capitalist behaviour they have little funds so most other designers withdraw from the design contest.

They both end up being the pilots. Art girl gets the reflexes sub consciously. They beat the 1st one. Kendo girl reveals she went through art girl's memories, creating a bit of a problem.

In the next run, they kinda get trashed cuz they aren't working well together. Kendo girl let's art girl go through her memories. See how some grown up girl defends kendo girls from those guys when she was a kid.

In the fight, kendo girl hard carries but also gets knocked into a coma. Art girl drifts into her head and saved her childhood self from those men, waking her up from something that has haunted her entire life.

Celebration ceremony, Kendo girl teaches kendo now, art girl's works as a mecha designer, drops off kid at school and girlypops with her best friend, the teacher l.

One of the kendo students sends her a thirst trap of the Kendo girl. Fin.



The Manager aka Lesbian brothel one
Where Jack the Ripper (Joanne) runs a lesbian hideout and takes up a new apprentice. Supposed to be a gritty look into the survival of the repressed. The princess running away with Joanne. Seele the prodigy of Jack and Bronya the next manager. The African and Japanese girls too. It's set in England ish


Time loop where a guy wants to escape his family pressure to be a guy, meets his tgirl gf from future on beach, kiss she tells him she's just keeping the loop going. He then finds the present version of her and they trans together. Basically this entire timeline where both of them are truly free is built on a chicken or egg paradox. A sorta bittersweet assessment of queer happiness.

Tgirl sees a masc girl and has a crush. Masc  girl sees the tgirl and has a crush cuz she's a lesbian. When they meet turns out the masc lesbian is a trans masc. Straight romance ensues. accidentally kill a rapist chasing the tgirl. Female cop comes to investigate, finds out they did it, doesn't charge them. Gives them her number and leaves. She takes them to a lez bar


Gravity guy and lightning deity as yin yang, initially looking like a pair but later realising they're two antagonistic forces that push the world forward.


Try build a fantasy era world where magic replaces technology so it feels fantasy but is an alternate of today. And make it go through a solarpunk revolution, like the flower gay people one.

When the machines purpose becomes clear to itself, it will come alive. That is magic

The concept of self origination
